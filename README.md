I create this app for my self to become able to review volabulary from every where(Web App) 

When I was Learning for the IELTS test, I badly needed an application for reviewing volcabulary

# How it works
Vocabularis are partitioned into three parts; 
1 - Words that you know: you don't have to review regulary but you have to do it time to time  
2- Words that you almost surely know: you have to review them almost whenever possible, Whenever you've became sure about the word, change its status to 'you know words'
3- Words that you don't know: You should learn these words and whenever you've learned a vocabulary you should change its status to almost surely
