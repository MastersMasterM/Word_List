# Word-List App



This is a simple web application built with Flask, SQLite, HTML5 and CSS. The app allows users to create a list of words they want to learn and categorize them based on their level of familiarity with the word.



## Features



- Users can add new words to their list

- Words are categorized into three sections: known, almost known, and unknown

- Users can edit or delete existing words from their list

- The app keeps track of when each word was last reviewed and suggests when it should be reviewed again based on the user's level of familiarity with the word
